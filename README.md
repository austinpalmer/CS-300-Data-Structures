# CS-300-Data-Structures

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the first project we created pseudocode and a runtime analyis for methods that input, store, and output courses from data structures: vector, hash table, and binary search tree. In the second project we implemented this pseudocode and designed a program to input, store, and output courses from a binary search treee.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this problem by analysing the algorithms associated with these structures and then applying that to the situation. Data structures are important to understand to improve program performance and functionality. Additionally, each data structure has its advantages and disadvantages which make them useful when approaching a specific problem.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Most of the roadblocks I encountered I was able to go back in the textbook and analyze the algorithms. The videos for the hash and binary tree assignments were particularly helpful when trying to implement the node aspect of these structures.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Before this class I never thought of the runtime complexity of the code I was writing but now I understand that anytime a program loops or stores data it changes how fast the program will/could operate. With my knew knowledge of data structures I can apply each of the learned structures to different scenarios.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project made me think of the way that programs can adapt and maintain their data. For example, if data is originally stored in a binary tree but now the data is stored differently then how will that affect the program? It is important to address the needs of the program to make the program as maintainable as possible which includes storing data in the adequate structure.
